# Bootcamp applicative team project (120h work) - Wildfire-USA

We couldn't host our Streamlit presentation online and had to keep it local due to the large file sizes of our machine learning results, even after adding a compression script to our code. However, the streamlit.py script is uploaded if you'd like to review it.

You can also read our project report by opening the named file. It details all the steps we followed for this project, including our visualizations and machine learning results. Please note that the report is written in French, as I graduated from a French data school.

Thanks for your attention
